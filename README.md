## About Me

I’m a builder at heart — I like turning ideas into real, working products.  
Currently pursuing a **B.Tech** alongside a **B.S. in Data Science**, and exploring the intersection of **engineering, design, and impact**.

Right now, I’m focused on:
- Building real-world projects
- Strengthening problem-solving and system thinking
- Learning by shipping, not just studying

I enjoy experimenting, iterating, and improving — one commit at a time.
