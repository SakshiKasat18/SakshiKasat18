## About Me

I’m a curious builder who enjoys turning ideas into real, working products.  
I like learning by doing, experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, and iterating until something meaningful comes out.

Currently, I’m pursuing a **B.Tech** alongside a **B.S. in Data Science**, exploring the intersection of **engineering, design, data, and impact**.

I’m deeply interested in:
- building products that solve real problems  
- understanding how systems work (not just how to code them)  
- combining logic with creativity  
- and growing through hands-on experimentation rather than just theory  

I believe progress should be visible. I like seeing ideas take shape, even if they start messy.  
For me, learning is not about perfection — it’s about momentum.

## What I’m Focused On Right Now

- Strengthening problem-solving & DSA fundamentals  
- Building end-to-end projects (not just components)  
- Exploring frontend architecture and UI logic  
- Learning backend workflows and data handling  
- Contributing to open-source and collaborative builds  
- Developing the habit of shipping consistently  

I’m not in a rush to “look impressive.”  
I’m more interested in **becoming solid.**

## Projects

### 🌌 CodeGalaxy  
A web-based productivity system where every focus session becomes a celestial object in a personal galaxy.  
Instead of boring streaks and numbers, effort is visualized through stars, planets, and cosmic growth — making progress feel tangible and motivating.

Built with the idea that:
> consistency should feel rewarding, not repetitive.

---

### 🎧 Loci – Audio Travel Guide  
An intelligent, location-based audio guide that narrates the story of places as you move.  
Designed to make travel immersive and hands-free — like having a storyteller in your ear while you explore.

Focus areas:
- location awareness  
- clean UX flow  
- contextual content delivery  

---

### 🌱 Breathe Green  
A smart sustainability tool that converts everyday activities into clear, data-backed CO₂ insights.  
Helps users understand their carbon footprint and make better environmental choices without guilt or confusion.

Built around:
- clarity over complexity  
- data that actually makes sense  
- sustainability without preachiness  

---

### 🎬 Clones & UI Builds  
I’ve built multiple clones to understand real-world UI patterns, layout structure, and component behavior.

Includes:
- Netflix Clone  
- Spotify Clone  
- X (Twitter) Clone  

These projects helped me:
- understand design systems  
- practice responsive layouts  
- and learn how real products are structured

---

### 🧩 Portfolio  
My personal space on the web — designed to reflect not just what I’ve built, but how I think.  
An evolving project that grows as I grow.

---

### 📚 Classroom & Practice Projects  
Smaller builds created through coursework, practice sessions, and exploration.  
Each one teaches me something — even if it’s just what not to do next time.

## How I Like To Work

- I prefer building over over-planning  
- I like clarity, structure, and clean logic  
- I enjoy learning in public and sharing progress  
- I’m not afraid to start small and iterate  
- I care about both **how it works** and **how it feels**  

I value environments where:
- people are curious  
- ideas are explored  
- and growth is encouraged
