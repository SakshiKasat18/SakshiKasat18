# Hi, I’m Sakshi 👋

Curious builder. Learning in public. Shipping with intent.

I’m pursuing a BTech along with a BS in Data Science and learn best by building real projects — turning ideas into working systems and improving them step by step. I enjoy working on products that combine logic, usability, and clean design.

## 🚀 What I’m currently working on

Right now, I’m focused on:
- Writing better **Python** and backend logic  
- Building clean, responsive **frontend interfaces**  
- Learning **Data Structures & Algorithms** for strong problem-solving  
- Exploring **open-source** and real-world codebases  
- Understanding how products are designed, built, and scaled  

I try to learn by doing, not just by reading.
