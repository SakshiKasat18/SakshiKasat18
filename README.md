## About

I'm a first-year computer science student building toward **backend and systems work** through open source and project-driven learning. I focus on how APIs, services, and data flow fit together in practical products.

Most of my progress comes from reading production code, shipping small features, and fixing real issues. That process keeps me grounded in test quality, contributor workflows, and how software evolves in the real world.

This profile is a reflection of that journey.

## Current Focus

- Contributing to open source through **Summer of Bitcoin**
- Understanding large production codebases and test infrastructure
- Building complete backend systems and APIs
- Working with **Loci** and **CodeGalaxy** MVPs
- Learning systems programming and database architecture

The goal is simple: **learn by shipping, contribute meaningfully, build with intent.**
