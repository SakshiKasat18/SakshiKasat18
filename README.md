## About

I’m currently pursuing a **B.Tech** alongside a **B.S. in Data Science**, and spending most of my time building, breaking, and refining things on the web.

I’m interested in how ideas turn into systems - how interfaces meet logic, how products take shape, and how small decisions compound into real impact.

This profile is a reflection of that process.

## Current Focus

- Strengthening problem-solving and DSA fundamentals  
- Building complete, end-to-end projects  
- Understanding frontend structure and component design  
- Learning backend workflows and data handling  
- Exploring open-source and collaborative development  

The goal is simple: **build more, understand better, ship consistently.**
